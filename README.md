## Download
You can download the class materials using the following command line.

	$ git clone https://github.com/wanirepo/Stats2_2021Fall

Once you clone the github repository, you can just type the following command to get the updated github repository. 

	$ git pull
	
Or you can download the repository as a zip file or you can also use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). The class materials will be uploaded (e.g., lecture slides, assignments) before each class. 

There is a good github tutorial: [https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html)

## What are the aims of this course?

Data are everywhere. It is a big data era. Data science already became a key element in many research and industrial areas. The primary aim of this course is to learn basic concepts and skills for data analysis, including concepts of random variables, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, linear modeling, data visualization, etc., preparing students for their lives after the graduation in this data-are-everywhere age. This class, “Biostats and Big data 2”, is the advanced version of the “Biostats and Big data” course. You will also get some hands-on experience and in-depth study materials for statistics. If you did not finish the “Biostats and Big data”, I recommend you attending the class first.

## Course format (flipped classroom) and expectations

- This class was designed as a flipped classroom format, but due to the covid pandemic, I'm running it as an online format (only online). I will use the JAMOVI tutorial videos (provided by [datalab.cc](https://datalab.cc/jamovi/) and also will make and use my own new tutorial videos (I might use some videos from last year, but I will try to make new ones this semester). In the meantime, you will learn how to run the analyses with the real data through livestream. 

- I'm planning to have one livestream and one recording sessions for each week, but it could be adjusted the week-by-week basis. One of the important goals for this semester is to make a good tutorial videos that I can use in future years (which require a lot of time and energy), which could cause some adjustments for some weeks (please understand). But I will do my best to provide the best class. 

- This class was designed to give students hands-on experience on statistical analyses, and so we are supposed to do our class in the computer lab (컴퓨터실습실). However, given the covid situation, you need to use your own computer for the practice and also the homework. Thus we decided to use JAMOVI, which is free and light software that most of you should be able to run in your computer. If you cannot run the JAMOVI in your personal computer, please let me know. I will try to open the computer labs for a few days for your homework. 

- For those who want some advanced stuff, I will provide lectures on the advanced stats (e.g., resampling methods, Monte Carlo sampling, multi-level general linear model, and mediation analysis, etc.) with matlab or R examples. You won't need to know these additional stuff for your homework, but these will be helpful for you to thrive in the future. :) 

## Textbooks

Main textbook: <br>
>"Stats: Data and Models" by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock<br>"Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century" by Russell Poldrack [Link](https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/)


## Softwares

I will use [JAMOVI](https://www.jamovi.org/) mainly, but I will use matlab and R for some weeks. For homework assignments, you will need only JAMOVI.


## Evaluation

Absolute evaluation will be used for this course. 

1. Attendance (30%)
2. Participation (including pop-questions) (20%)
3. Homeworks (there will be four HW assignments throughout the semester including the term paper; 6%/10%/14%/20%) (50%)
